# adoshopbasic

This is windows-only project, sad but true.

How to start:

1. start `install_postgres.cmd`
2. start `PostgreSQLPortable.exe` from newly created `PostgreSQLPortable` directory.
3.  `CREATE USER shop_ado WITH password 'shop_ado';`
4. `ALTER USER shop_ado CREATEDB;`
5. build a `adoShopBackend` solution and start coding.
